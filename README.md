 i live in Israel and I love technology very much. I'm familiar with Israel from my other projects and I enjoy sharing what I do.

The project presented - is my smart home project. Where I sat for hours and was helped by good friends like [Eliran Turgeman](https://github.com/VirtualL/HomeAssistant-Config), [Yuval Majhaz] (https://github.com/rt400/Shabbat-Times)
